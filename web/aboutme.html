<h4 >Well umm, I am a Junior Java Developer, an Amateur Designer, Video Editor and a Gamer. I guess thats about it.</h4>
<p>And this here is my WebPage, basically this site acts like my CV, you could call it my online resume of sorts. Well, the thing is I just finished creating this site and most downloads/live links don't work. Some of the pages don't work as well, sorry for that I will update the pages soon.</p>

<h4 >And now its been a few years. Now I am a Senior Java Developer and Scala Developer and working as a Deprt. Head for a Software Development Company.</h4>
<p>Right now I am more invested in creating web clients in Scala/Play and utilizing the Platform3 web service.</p>
